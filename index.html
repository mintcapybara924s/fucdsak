    <h1>Welcome</h1>
    <p>The European Parliament’s rapporteur on the digital euro file, centre-right MEP Fernando Navarrete, in a recent article, claimed to offer a “rational common ground” to discuss the proposal for a European Central Bank digital currency (CBDC). 

However, his approach reflects a fear of transition: warning of financial instability, lost innovation, and privacy risks, while ignoring the costs of maintaining the status quo. 

He also disregards the numerous calls by civil society, academics and research institutions for digital public money since the 2008 financial crisis. 

A digital euro would give people universal access to safe electronic money, strengthen financial resilience, and deliver lower prices and better services. 

As with any political debate, arguments are informed by different perspectives on what kind of society we want. 

Navarrete reasons from a competitive market economy perspective, where state action is justified only in cases of clear market failure. In this view, markets are better suited to meet social needs, with state intervention kept to a minimum. 

But the EU treaties enshrine a highly competitive social market economy. In this perspective, markets drive prosperity, and the state upholds social cohesion and guarantees universal access to essential goods and services, including money and payments。
